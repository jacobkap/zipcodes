Description: Provides a dataset containing city, county, county FIPS codes,
    and state FIPS codes for 40569 zipcodes in the United States. It also includes
    functions to easily grab relevant data or convert zipcodes to county FIPS codes.
    This allows you to merge various datasets that do not include FIPS codes (e.g.
    The Uniform Crime Report datasets) to those that do as well as make maps using
    the choropleth package.
